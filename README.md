# leaflet-challenge

Takes in data from the USSG website and uses magnitude and coordinate points to map earthquakes on a map with different layers for better viewing. The magnitude of the earthquakes are color coded and labeled in a legend in the bottom left. It is the easy for the the user to understand what each point represents by either clicking on the point on the map or looking at the legend with the color relationship.
